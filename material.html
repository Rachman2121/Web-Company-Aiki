                <h1>Mendong or Fimbris Umbrellaris</h1>
                <p>Mendong (Fimbristylis umbellaris) or also called purun rat is a type of grass that lives in
                    swamps, including members of the Cyperaceae tribe. This plant produces woven material, so it is
                    cultivated in several areas<br /> <br />
                    Mendong is widespread in Indonesia and is found in all regions.
                    It grows in swampy areas and grass fields. Also in irrigated, rainfed, lowland rice fields, and
                    tidal rice fields. Mendong grows well in areas with temperatures ranging from 25-27 degrees and
                    sufficient light exposure. Mendong generally grows wild in wet areas, for example in rice fields
                    with a soil pH range of 4.5-8 in lowland areas (more than 1000 meters above sea level).

                <h1>Benefit</h1>
                <p>Mendong is planted like planting rice in a rice field, but it is maintained that the fields are
                    always watery. Mendong clumps are sickled after 6-9 months. After being selected, the stems of the
                    mendong were dried in the sun, sometimes rubbed and flattened first
                    <br /> <br /> Mendong of good quality, after
                    drying to form sheets as wide as lk. 4 mm, flat, soft, and feels a bit chewy. These sheets are then
                    woven to make mats and various other weaves. Now the mendong woven material is further processed to
                    be used as room slippers, bags, box or tube containers, table decorations and others.

                    The main products of Mendong are handicrafts such as mats, ropes, bags, and other woven items.
                    Tasikmalaya makes mendong crafts as one of its creative industry commodities. The use of mendong as
                    a raw material for handicrafts is based on the strong and elastic nature of the mendong plant so
                    that it can be shaped and woven. For this mendong handicraft product, there is no specific
                    standardization that regulates the quality of the product. In addition, Mendong is one of the
                    members of the Cyperaceae family which is known as a metal hyper-accumulator plant that is tolerant
                    of high environmental metal concentrations so that it is used as Phytoremediation. Currently,
                    mendong fiber is being developed as a raw material for Microcrytalline Cellulose (MCC) which is used
                    as a filler in medicine, stabilizer in the food industry, and composite material in the plastics
                    industry. MCC from mendong is expected to replace MCC from wood, thereby reducing deforestation and
                    being more environmentally friendly.
